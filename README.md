# Introduction

**AutoCRUD** is a revolutionary, fully automated CRUD system powered by **AJAX** and **Tailwind CSS** that intelligently detects your database structure and dynamically generates complete, production-ready interfaces without manual configuration.

## How It Works

The system performs deep database analysis using advanced SQL queries to automatically discover table structures, column types, constraints, and foreign key relationships. This intelligence drives dynamic generation of appropriate HTML elementsâ€”from text inputs and dropdowns to file uploads and date pickersâ€”all tailored to your specific database schema.

Built around three core components: **`table_functions.php`** (the intelligent engine with reusable functions), **`table_alias.php`** (customization hub using smart keyword mapping), and **`config.php`** (secure database foundation). The system transforms raw database metadata into contextually appropriate user interfaces that feel hand-crafted for your data.

**Key Benefits**: Zero configuration deployment, intelligent field detection, real-time AJAX search with pagination, responsive design, built-in security, and performance optimizationâ€”turning hours of CRUD development into minutes of effortless automation.

To be able to make this system your own, read carefully the comments of `table_alias.php` and adjust the keyword according to your own needs.

<h1>Getting Started</h1>
The system is implememnted and deployed as a feature of [https://canmansys.littledoiknow.com/admin/dashboard.php]. Explore the various tables on the sidebar, watch them generate dynamically by changing the URL query, try editing and find out the forms also generating dynamically, all rendered on the server side.


<h2>Installation</h2>
To seamlessly integrate the AutoCRUD system into your project, follow these simple installation steps:
<h3> Download Source Code:</h3>
  <li>Visit the GitHub repository at <a href="https://github.com/omsrivastava512/AutoCRUD">AutoCRUD</a> and download the source code.
<h3>Integration:</h3>
  <li>Integrate the downloaded source code into your project's admin panel.



<h2>Setup</h2>
Configure AutoCRUD to align with your project requirements by following these setup instructions:
<ol>
  <h3> <li>
    
  Edit `config.php`:
  </h3>Locate the config.php file and update the following values:
  <ul>
    <li type = disc>Username
    <li type = disc>Password
    <li type = disc>Database name
    <li type = disc>Server name
  </ul>

   <h3> <li>
    
  Customize `$showAliases`:
  </h3>
  
  In the `table_alias.php`, 
  <ul>
    <li type = disc>Navigate to the $showAliases array.
    <li type = disc>Create a switch case for every table in your database.
    <li type = disc>Beneath each case, assign an associative array to $showAliases, mapping original attribute names in the table to preferred display names as keys and values, respectively.
  </ul>

  The $showAliases array stores the fields that you want to be displayed in the table_show.php. Another array `$inputAliases` stores the fields that are allowed to take input through a form. Please follow the above instructions for this array as well.
  Additionally, insert  `$nameField` and `$searchField` too inside the switch case, if needed.

   <h3> <li> 
     
   Customize `$tableAliases` array:
   </h3> 
    Store the display name of the tables in the similar fashion.

   <h3> <li> 
     
   Customize `$foreignKey` array:
   </h3> Stores the primary keys of the tables that are acting as foreign keys in the corresponding table case.

  <h3> <li> 
     
   Customize `$categoryColumnList` array:
   </h3> 

  Store the column of the related table that is to fetched using the foreign key. For example, `category_name` is fetched using the foreign key `category_id` from the table `item_category`.
 
  <h3><li> Additional Notes

  Add your primary keys fields of each table in the `toHide` array in no specific order. <br>

  Whenever you have make any change in the HTML of `table_show.php`, make sure you replicate those changes in `search.php`, or create a reusable page that generates the tables altogether.<br>
